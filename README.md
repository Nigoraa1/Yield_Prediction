## Overview
The project aims to predict crop yield by leveraging machine learning techniques to analyze various features. By building and refining predictive models, this project explores the primary factors impacting yield and provides insights to enhance agricultural productivity.

## Dataset
The dataset includes features such as soil properties, weather patterns, crop types, and geographic data, which are all relevant to crop yield predictions. Users can utilize their own datasets with similar features, adjusting data loading and preprocessing steps as needed.

## Installation
To work with this project, users need Python 3.x and a list of specific Python packages. All necessary libraries can be found in the requirements.txt file, which should be installed prior to running the project.

## Usage
Once the required packages are installed, users can begin experimenting with the prediction models. Configurations such as the choice of model, input features, and evaluation metrics can be customized within the configuration file.

## Modeling Approach
The project applies various machine learning algorithms to build a robust prediction model. Key steps include:

Data preprocessing and feature engineering
Selecting models such as Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting
Tuning hyperparameters to optimize performance
The project identifies the best model by comparing results across multiple evaluation metrics.

## Results
Results from model training and evaluation are saved, including:

Performance metrics such as RMSE and R-squared
Visualizations comparing predicted vs. actual yields
Rankings of feature importance, highlighting the most influential variables
